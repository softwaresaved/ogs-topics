| 1     |                       | Is the software's design documented? |
| 1.1   | 1                     | Is there an overview of the architecture and how the various components or functions work together? |
| 1.1.1 | 1.1                   | Are diagrams used to illustrate the software's architecture? |
| 1.2   | 1                     | Are the software's requirements referenced from which the software design is derived? |
| 1.2.1 | 1.2                   | Can elements of the software design be traced back to specific requirements? |
| 1.3   | 1                     | Are specifications for the software's interfaces (such as APIs) documented? |
| 1.4   | 1                     | Is the model of the data used, represented, and stored by the software documented? |
| 1.5   | 1                     | Are there clear and documented ways to extend the functionality of the software? |
| 1.6   | 1                     | Is the design of any domain algorithms to be used by the software documented? |
| 1.7   | 1                     | Are any publications regarding algorithms used by the software referenced within its documentation? |
| 2     |                       | Is the software designed in a modular way, with separate features or capabilities logically divided into separate software components? |
| 2.1   | 2                     | Has the software been designed such that specific features or functions can be reused in other software? |
| 3     |                       | Is the software designed to make use of open data formats established within your user community? |
| 4     |                       | Is the software designed to be compatible with your expected user's platforms? |
| 5     |                       | Is the software designed to support compliance to relevant data standards (such as GDPR, if the software handles user data)? |
| 6     |                       | Does the flow of data through the software's components follow its flow of control? |
| 7     |                       | Has the user interface been designed with input from its eventual end-users? |
| 8     |                       | Is there sufficient evidence that the software's dependencies (such as other third-party software and libraries) will be available for the anticipated lifetime of the software? |

# Online Guidance Service - topics and questions for comment

*How do you assess an aspect of research software in 20 questions?*

This repository aims to collect early feedback on draft questions designed to assess research software, which are to be used by the Institute's Online Guidance Service currently in development. We're keen to involve the community early on to help us improve these questions, and any feedback is greatly appreciated!
